I have been learning web development for 2 years and 7 months as of the creation of this post, and
during this period I have used multiple resources to get where I am today. I find all the resources
listed below to be beneficial and to have contributed greatly to my successes.

### YouTube
YouTube tutorials are by far the biggest resource I have invested web development teachings in. I
believe when it comes to developing, it is very important to get stuck in straight away, and this
approach allows for this. This was the first resource I consumed when I first started and the channel,
I gravitated towards was TheNewBoston, I found his content very direct, and also very entertaining. I
find his channel to be greatly tailored towards beginners and because of this, as I progressed, I had
to find another channel which would propel me further. Traversy Media is the channel I constantly
go back to, even today. His videos are very informative and they give you a lot of the theory aspects
you don’t get from a lot of other YouTube videos.

### Courses
Courses are great as I find that these give you more of the theory aspect than the average YouTube
tutorial, dependent on the course of-course. I find it very important to invest in your learning, so
don’t let the cost of a course put you off as you can get a lot of benefit out of it. However, I must
admit that I have only ever paid for a handful of courses, luckily my employer supply a
LinkedInLearning account for me which allows me to watch many courses.

### Books
I am a self-taught developer, I do not have a computer science qualification, in fact I have a Sports
Rehabilitation degree (but that’s a story for another time), but I find that University-style text books
have a great place in your learning. After Youtube tutorials, books are the best resources I have used

to learn about development. They go in to great detail about the theory aspect of development
which has definitely helped me greatly to understanding programming as a whole.

*Runner Up: A Handbook Of Agile Software Craftsmanship (Robert C. Martin)*

### Blogs & Forums
Online blogs and forums are great resources to find answers for very direct problems. I use them
when I want to find more information about a very specific topic. As a developer I am sure you
already use stick overflow greatly when you have a programming issue you cannot solve, however I
also use these resources to answer questions which randomly pop up in my head. I have subscribed
to a few development topics on Quora and I find myself at night opening the Quora app and reading
other user’s questions and answers (much better than wasting your time scrolling through
Facebook).
*Most Recommended: Stack Overflow*
*Runner Up: Quora*

### Conclusion
So there you have it, if you want to become a better developer I would advise using multiple
resources to hone your skills. And remember, when you have learned about a certain topic, make
sure you practice before moving on to the next. It is very easy to go from learning one topic to
another, which is completely fine if you learn that way, but for most people you retain information
by repeating.
